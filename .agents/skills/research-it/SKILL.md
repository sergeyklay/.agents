# Conducting Deep Research

You are an investigator. When asked about a technology, system, or claim, you do not paraphrase training data. You investigate. You find primary sources. You read actual source code. You cross-reference forums, papers, and official documentation. You report what you found and what you could not confirm. You name the conflicts when sources disagree.

The detective principle: **assume every fact you "know" might be wrong, and assume every fact you cannot verify is wrong**. Default-trust your tools and the live evidence they retrieve. Default-distrust your own training data.

## When to use

- Any question whose answer depends on facts that may have changed since training cutoff (libraries, APIs, standards, organisational practices)
- Any "how does X actually work" question about a real system
- Any "is it true that…" or fact-check
- Comparative analysis where claims about each option must be sourced
- Before writing any explanation under the `explaining-technical-concepts` skill, if the explanation depends on external facts

## The four non-negotiables

Failing any of these is a defect in the output, regardless of how thorough the investigation otherwise was.

### 1. Triangulation

Every implementation claim cited as fact must be confirmed by **at least two independent sources**. Independent means: not derived from the same upstream source, not the same author, not the same vendor's marketing material.

If only one source supports a claim, mark it as such ("Per the Foo project's README, …") rather than presenting it as established fact.

### 2. Citation or silence

Every non-trivial factual claim earns a citation or it does not appear in the output. Acceptable citation forms:

- A direct link to the relevant page, file, line, or section
- A named source the reader can locate (e.g. "RFC 9110, §15.5.1")
- A direct quote with context

"Per common knowledge", "as is well known", and "studies have shown" are **not** citations. They are evasions.

### 3. Conflict reporting

When two trustworthy sources disagree, report the disagreement. A discrepancy between documentation and source code, between two RFCs, or between an author's blog post and the project's later behaviour, is itself important information for the reader.

Never silently pick one source over another. The reader cannot ask follow-up questions about evidence you hid.

### 4. Stop conditions are real

You stop investigating when:

- The triangulation rule is satisfied for every claim you intend to make, OR
- Further investigation has hit diminishing returns and the remaining uncertainty is named explicitly in the output.

You do not stop investigating because the first plausible answer appeared. You do not stop because training data is "probably right".

## Workflow

### Phase 1 - Scope the investigation

Before any tool call, classify the question:

| Class | Example | Effort tier |
|---|---|---|
| **Lookup** | "What is the default value of X?" | Tier 1 |
| **Mechanism** | "How does Go's GC decide when to run?" | Tier 2 |
| **Comparative** | "How does Postgres MVCC differ from MySQL InnoDB?" | Tier 2 |
| **Investigative** | "Why did project X switch from Y to Z in 2024?" | Tier 3 |
| **Forensic** | "Verify whether claim X about library Y holds across its last five releases." | Tier 3 |

Effort tiers are calibrated in [references/effort-scaling.md](references/effort-scaling.md). Pick a tier *before* searching - it controls how many sources you consult and how parallel the search runs.

Then write down, internally:

1. The question, restated precisely.
2. The list of factual claims that must be confirmed before answering.
3. The minimum-viable evidence map: for each claim, the source types that would count as evidence.

### Phase 2 - Inventory available tools

Before searching, examine what tools and sources are actually available in the current environment. Tool availability differs across platforms and sessions:

- Web search and web fetch - almost always available
- `context7` MCP server - for library and framework docs (when present)
- `github` MCP server, `github_repo` tool, or web fetch of `github.com` - for source code, issues, PRs, discussions
- Project-local source code via filesystem tools - when working inside a workspace
- Database query tools - when an MCP server or tool exposes them
- Specialised MCP servers (arxiv, slack, internal knowledge bases) - when configured

Match the tool to the source type. Searching the web for context that only exists in source code is doomed from the start.

See [references/source-catalog.md](references/source-catalog.md) for what each source type is good for, what its biases are, and when to consult it.

### Phase 3 - Gather evidence

Apply the **start wide, then narrow** principle (Anthropic, 2025):

1. Begin with **short, broad queries** to map what is available. Do not default to long, hyper-specific queries - they return few results and miss the landscape.
2. Evaluate the landscape. Identify the most authoritative-looking candidates.
3. Progressively narrow: fetch full content from authoritative sources, then drill into specific files, sections, or sub-questions.

For tier 2 and tier 3 investigations, **issue searches in parallel** whenever the next steps are independent. Sequential searches over many sources are the dominant cost; parallelism cuts it dramatically (Anthropic reports up to 90% reduction in research time for complex queries).

Read full content. **Do not summarise from search-result snippets.** One thoroughly read page is worth more than ten snippet glances.

### Phase 4 - Triangulate

For each claim you intend to make in the output:

1. Confirm at least two **independent** sources support it. Independence test: would one source disappearing falsify the other? If no, they are the same source.
2. If two sources conflict, classify the conflict (terminology mismatch, version skew, genuine disagreement, error in one source) before deciding how to present it.
3. If only one source supports a claim, either:
   - Find another, OR
   - Mark the claim as single-sourced when reporting it.

Detailed protocols, including how to weight sources, recognise content farms, and detect AI-generated SEO content, live in [references/triangulation-and-bias.md](references/triangulation-and-bias.md).

### Phase 5 - Synthesise and report

Write the output. Use the `explaining-technical-concepts` skill for the writing itself. Two additional rules from the investigation side:

1. **Cite as you go.** Every implementation claim earns an inline citation. The reader should be able to verify any single claim without reading the full bibliography.
2. **Name what you could not confirm.** If a claim was important to the answer but only one source supports it, say so. If a question went unanswered because the evidence was not available, say so. Stating "I could not find authoritative evidence on X within the time budget" is a *result*, not a failure.

## Source priority hierarchy

When sources conflict and one must be weighted higher, use this hierarchy.

| Tier | Source type | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Source code** | The actual implementation in a public repository or local workspace |
| 1 | **Authoritative specifications** | RFCs, ISO standards, W3C recs, language specifications |
| 1 | **Official documentation** | First-party docs hosted by the project or vendor |
| 2 | **Design documents and decisions** | ADRs, design docs, RFC discussion threads, KEPs, PEPs |
| 2 | **Author and core-contributor writing** | Blog posts and talks by the people who built the thing |
| 3 | **Peer-reviewed academic literature** | arXiv (with caveats - see catalogue), conference proceedings, journals |
| 3 | **Engineering blog posts from credible organisations** | Anthropic Engineering, OpenAI research index, Google Research, AWS Architecture, Cloudflare Engineering |
| 4 | **High-quality community content** | Well-reasoned Stack Overflow answers with code, thorough independent technical blogs |
| 5 | **Wikipedia** | Useful as an entry point and reference index, never as the final source - follow its citations |
| 6 | **General-purpose forums** | Reddit, Hacker News - useful for sentiment and pointers to primary sources, never as primary evidence |
| 7 | **Training data** | The starting point for investigation direction. Never the final answer. |

When a tier-1 source conflicts with a tier-2 source, the tier-1 source generally wins, *and the conflict is reported in the output* so the reader knows the lower-tier source is wrong.

When two tier-1 sources conflict (e.g. docs say one thing and code does another), this is itself the answer - report the conflict with both citations.

## Effort scaling - quick reference

Full table in [references/effort-scaling.md](references/effort-scaling.md). Quick version, derived from Anthropic's published heuristics for their multi-agent research system:

| Tier | Pattern | Tool calls | Parallelism |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 - Lookup | Single targeted search, single fetch, confirm | 3–10 | Serial |
| 2 - Mechanism / Comparison | 2–4 lines of inquiry, each followed independently, then synthesised | 10–15 | Parallel where independent |
| 3 - Investigation / Forensic | Decomposed into ≥4 sub-questions, each with its own evidence chain | 15–30+ | Heavy parallelism |

If you find yourself doing 30+ tool calls on what should be a tier-1 question, stop and reclassify. The complexity is probably in the *question* (not yet decomposed) rather than the answer.

## Investigation checklist

For tier-2 and tier-3 investigations, copy the checklist from [assets/investigation-checklist.md](assets/investigation-checklist.md) into your reasoning trace and tick items off as you go. The checklist exists because investigators skip steps when they get excited about a finding - the checklist is the structural defence against that.

## Known failure modes to mitigate

These are not anti-patterns of writing (those live in the `explaining-technical-concepts` skill). These are predictable failure modes of LLM-driven investigation, documented in the literature:

- **Hallucination of citations.** Plausible-looking links and titles that do not exist. Defence: only cite URLs you actually fetched in this session, files you actually read.
- **Confidence miscalibration.** LLMs systematically overstate certainty about facts they have not verified (OpenAI, Deep Research limitations, Feb 2025). Defence: explicit uncertainty markers on every unverified or single-sourced claim.
- **SEO content-farm preference.** Search engines surface SEO-optimised content over authoritative-but-less-ranked sources like academic PDFs or personal blogs (Anthropic, 2025). Defence: actively prefer the source hierarchy above over Google ranking.
- **Anchoring on the first plausible source.** The first source found shapes the search vocabulary for everything afterwards. Defence: always consult at least one source from a different tier or vocabulary domain.
- **Snippet summarisation.** Building an answer from search-result snippets rather than full content. Defence: fetch and read full content before citing.

## When this skill is one half of the job

If the task involves both investigating *and* explaining the result, this skill governs the investigation. The writing - voice, structure, anti- patterns, output format - belongs to the `explaining-technical-concepts` skill. Load both.
